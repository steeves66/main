# Django Feather

A simple Tag (`{% icon "name" %}`) to implement [Feather Icons](https://feathericons.com) in Django.

## Install
Install `django-feather` using `pip` and put it into your `INSTALLED_APPS`:
```bash
pip install django-feather
```  
`settings.py`:
```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # ...
    'django_feather',
    # ...
]
```

## Usage
After installation, the tag can be used just like any other tag:

```djangotemplate
{% load icon %}

<p>Using a string {% icon "coffee" class="css-class" height="8" width="8" %}</p>
<p>Using a variable {% icon self.icon class="css-class" height="8" width="8" %}</p>

```

The `icon` tag will simply take the SVG source from the Feather project,
apply additional attributes and return the SVG tag.

## Testing

There are a few tests in the `tests` directory that should test the
basic functions of this module. However, as these tests require the
package to be build (so that the `django_feather.icons` module is
populated), there are a few important steps to testing:

```shell
# Start by building the project
python setup.py build
# There should now be a build/lib directory present

# Make sure that django, pytest and pytest-django are installed:
pip install django pytest pytest-django

# Run the tests
export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=tests.settings
PYTHONPATH=build/lib:./ pytest tests 
```

The environment variable `PYTHONPATH` ensures that `django_feather` is
not imported from the current directory but rather from the `build/lib`
directory.

## Performance
`django-feather` does not read the `.svg` files each time an icon is rendered.
Instead, all the icons are written to a `.py` file upon build, just like the JavaScript
library.  
However, other than the JavaScript library, icons are rendered on the server side.
This avoids having to call `feather.replace()` after the page has loaded.
